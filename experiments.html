        <ul>
          <li><span class="tank-list">Overview</span>
            <p>"BM Oplot": The <span style="color:red">newest</span> and most <em>sophisticated</em> version of the T-84 is an upgraded version of the "T-84 Oplot" mounting
            more advanced armor, new electronic countermeasure systems, and others. One visible feature is the new PNK-6 panoramic tank sight.[12]</p>
          </li>
          <li><span class="tank-list">Design</span>
            <p>The <strong>BM Oplot</strong> is a further development of the previous Oplot, which is based on the T-84 main battle tank. The tank has a conventional layout
              with the driver's compartment at the front, fighting compartment in the middle and engine at the rear, accommodating a crew of three members. The driver sitting
              in the centre is provided with a single-piece hatch cover that opens to the right. The commander on the right and the gunner on the left have single-piece hatches.
              Tank has a length of 9.7 m (including the forward-facing gun), a width of 3.4 m without removable side skirts, and a height of 2.8 m. The combat weight of the tank
              is 51 tons.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><span class="tank-list">Armament</span>
            <p>The Oplot MBT is armed with a 125 mm smoothbore KBA-3 cannon, a KT-7.62 (PKT) Coaxial machine gun and a KT-12.7 anti-aircraft machine gun. The main gun is fed by
              a loading system equipped with conveyor, automatic loader and control system. The ammunition includes high explosive fragmentation (HE-FRAG), armour-piercing
              fin-stabilised discarding-sabot (APFSDS), high explosive anti tank (HEAT) and gun mount (GM) rounds.
              The main gun can also fire a laser guided missile against battle tanks, armoured vehicles and hovering helicopters within the range of 5,000m. The missile can be
              fired on the move against travelling targets. The tandem warhead fitted on the missile can defeat targets equipped with explosive reactive armour and advanced
              spaced armour.
              The Oplot has 46 rounds of ammunition for the main gun, of which 28 rounds are placed in the automatic loader. Other ammunition types carried are 1,250 rounds for KT-7.62 machine gun, 450 rounds for KT-12.7 machine gun and 450 rounds for AKS submachine gun.[2]
